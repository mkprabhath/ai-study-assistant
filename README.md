# AI Study Assistant (v2)

## Overview
AI Study Assistant is a browser-based web application that helps students convert large study material into concise formats such as summaries, bullet points, and exam-ready notes.

This version focuses on frontend architecture and AI-readiness rather than real AI integration.

---

## What the Project Does
- Accepts raw study material as input
- Allows users to choose output format:
  - Summary
  - Bullet Points
  - Exam-Ready Notes
- Displays structured notes instantly in the browser

---

## Why This Project Exists
This project was built to:
- Apply Generative AI concepts in a practical way
- Understand how AI-driven systems are structured
- Practice separating UI logic from AI logic
- Prepare a foundation for future GenAI API integration

---

## How It Works (High Level)
1. User enters study material
2. UI sends input to a simulated AI engine
3. The AI engine returns formatted output
4. Results are displayed dynamically in the browser

The AI engine is currently mocked to simulate real behavior.

---

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Browser-based)

---

## Current Limitations
- No real Generative AI API is connected
- Output is simulated using frontend logic

---

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real Generative AI APIs (Gemini / OpenAI)
- Improved summarization logic
- Better UI and accessibility improvements

---

## Versioning
- v1: Python-based console prototype
- v2: Browser-based, AI-ready frontend architecture
